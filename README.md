## Data Resources:

**1. CSVs: Sales Data - https://www.zillow.com/research/data/**

**2. Google Sheets: Inventory Data - https://www.zillow.com/research/data/**

**3. Web Scraping: School's Data - www.greatschools.org**


# ETL Process:

## Extraction:

**1. CSVs (Data Resources/ZHVI dir):** 
- Zillow website provides ZHVI(Zillow Home Value Index) CSVs files. 
- It categories Home value on Numbers of Bed Room. Here 5 files are being used each per Bed Room count (i.e. Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_1.csv -> data for 1 Bed Room homes). 
- Zillow provides monthly data from year 1996 in form of one column per month.

|  Home Category  |       File Name        |  Data Size (Columns * Rows)  |File Size|
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -----------------------------| --------|
| 1 Bed Room      | Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_1.csv |      310 * 18459             | 35.3 MB |
| 2 Bed Room      | Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_2.csv |      310 * 26755             | 56.0 MB |
| 3 Bed Room      | Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_3.csv |      310 * 28800             | 63.0 MB |
| 4 Bed Room      | Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_4.csv |      310 * 26580             | 58.7 MB |
| 5 Bed Room      | Zip_zhvi_bdrmcnt_5.csv |      310 * 22074             | 48.8 MB |

**2. Google Sheets (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SCwfsJ8WD_295HeEOx8iBrM8mtwEzM7y):** 
- It provides monthly Sales and Newly Pending Inventory Listing's Raw Data.
- It also provides Rentals data(market rate rent across a given region) with Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing the mean of listed rents that fall into the 40th to 60th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is once again weighted to reflect the rental housing stock)

|      Data         |             File Name             |  Data Size (Columns * Rows)  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------- | -----------------------------|
| Sales Inventory   |  US_Sale_Inventory_Monthly        |            44 * 98           |

| Rentals           |  ZORI_AllHomesPlusMultifamily_ZIP |            89 * 2069         |

- It scrapes listing of around 250 public schools in San Jose distributed across more than 10 pages
- It includes detail like district name, school type, rating, grades, student per teacher ratio, total students enrolled, zip code etc.
- The listing on website provides 25 schools on one page
- It extracts rating, school name from the first column of listing
- It scrapes zip code from address from first column as well.

- It also extracts states' names from csv file located at Data Resources/States.csv.

## Load:
- It loads all the transformed data in to PostgreSQL database named zillow_db
- At first, it checks whether zillow_db database is already exists or not
- If itâ€™s not then, it will create a New database with name zillow_db
- It will connect to zillow_db database to create all the tables
- One by one it will create tables and provides acknowledgement for the same

|    Table Name     |         Data               |   Key Columns                           | Data Size (Columns * Rows)    |
|-------------------| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
|  sales            |   Sales                    |  Zip Code, City, State, Month/Year      | 79 * 122753                   |

|  inventory_sales  |   Sales Inventory          |  Region Name, State, Month/Year         | 44 * 98                       |

|  rentals          |   Rental Inventory         |  Zip Code, Msa Name, State, Month/Year  | 89 * 2069                     |
|  schools          |   Schools' listing         |  Zip Code, School Name, Rating          | 6 * 246                       |

**Why PostgreSQL was choosen?** 
- PostgreSQL free, open-source database.
- PostgreSQL is a relational database management system ( RDBMS ).
- This dataset has more relational data where all tables are related by Zip Code / State.
